# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two machine learning projects implemented using Keras. The first project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a neural network model, while the second project implements a text classification model using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).

## Project 1: MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

### Description

This code demonstrates the implementation of a neural network model using Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### Files

mnist-training.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for building, training, and evaluating the neural network model.
README.md: Providing an overview of the project.

### Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Open mnist-training.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Run the notebook cells to execute the code and train the model.

Evaluate the model's performance and explore the results.

## Project 2: Text Classification using GRU

### Description

This code implements a text classification model using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) in Keras. The model is trained on a dataset containing text samples and their corresponding categories. The goal is to predict the category of a given text sample.

### Files

training-category-eng-a01.py: Containing the code for preprocessing the text data, building and training the GRU-based text classification model.
README.md: Providing an overview of the project.

### Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the python file to execute the code and train the text classification model.

Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions on new text samples.

## Conclusion

These two projects showcase the implementation of machine learning models using Keras. The first project demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits, while the second project focuses on text classification using GRU. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own datasets and use cases.
